## Goal Digger
### About the App
Goal Digger is a new social media app that allows people to share their goals and the progress they make towards those goals.
The finished app would allow users to create a profile, create posts, follow other users, include hashtags in their posts, and includde mentions in their posts. Each user has a feed object associated with them, and new posts from other users they are following, hashtags they are following, and mentions of their name are added to the queue of their feed. Users would also be able to create goals, and track progress they make toward those goals. This social media app is designed to encourage people to set goals, make progress toward those goals, and network with other goal-diggers.

### App Development
Goal Digger was developed using behavior-driven development. In the planning stage, User Stories were created, and ordered by importance, feasibility, and difficulty in Trello. Sample use cases were developed to define the app's behavior. ER diagrams were constructed to created database schemas. All of the software design elements were then mapped into C# code, organized into projects, tested, analyzed, and deployed through Azure Pipelines.
