## Goal Digger
### About the App
Goal Digger is a new social media app that allows people to share their goals and the progress they make towards those goals.

### App Development
Goal Digger was developed using behavior-driven development. In the planning stage, User Stories were created, and ordered by importance, feasibility, and difficulty in Trello. Sample use cases were developed to define the app's behavior. ER diagrams were constructed to created database schemas. All of the software design elements were then mapped into C# code, organized into projects, tested, analyzed, and deployed through Azure Pipelines.
